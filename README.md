# Analisis-Regresi-Hazard-Aditif-Lin-Ying

Survival analysis is a statistical procedure for analyzing data with time to a certain event as a response variable. 
If we want to see the effect of the independent variable on the event response time 
variable in the survival analysis, regression analysis is used. One method that can 
be used is Lin-Ying Additive Hazard Regression with coefficient estimation using 
Maximum Partial Likelihood. The regression coefficient is constant so that it can 
be estimated directly and easier to interpret. In addition, this method can assess 
risk (In this study is clinical improvement) and more flexible because no 
proportionality assumption is made.
